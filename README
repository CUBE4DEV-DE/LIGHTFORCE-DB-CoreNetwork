CORENETWORK
===========

The CoreNetwork module is a collection of classes that provides 
functionality for building network-enabled applications.
It allows for efficient server management, handling client requests, and communication 
between a local and remote system with functionalities such as file synchronization.

The module contains four classes: XService, XServer, XClient, and XSync.

XService provides functions related to service management, such 
as setting and retrieving the root path, retrieving the 
service version number, and accessing the current logs.

XServer acts as a server for handling client requests.

XClient is an implementation of an object communicating via 
TCP and provides a variety of public static call and action methods.

XSync is a subclass of XServer that represents a network file synchronization
service. It is used for uploading, downloading, removing, and managing files
and directories between a local and remote system. 

XService
--------
The XService class is a subclass of QObject that is part of
the CoreNetwork namespace. It provides a number of functionalities that
are related to service management, such as setting and retrieving the root
path, retrieving the service version number, and accessing the current
logs. In addition to these built-in functionalities, XService also
provides a number of virtual functions that can be overridden to provide
additional functionality. For example, serviceName() can be overridden
to provide a custom name for the service, and serviceDescription()
can be overridden to provide a description of the service.

XServer
-------
The XServer class is a subclass of XService that acts as
a server for handling client requests. It provides functions for
opening the server on a specified port, checking the client's IP
address and port, and waiting for connections. It also allows
inclusion of other servers for efficient server management. The class
also contains slots for handling new incoming connections, reading
data from the connections, detecting errors and managing disconnections.
Overall, the XServer class is a useful tool when building
network-enabled applications in Qt.

XClient
-------
The XClient class is defined within the CoreNetwork namespace.
It inherits from the XService class and is essentially an implementation of
an object communicating via TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). It provides
a variety of public static call and action methods that allow users to connect
to a remote host and obtain information by sending TCP packets (data) to
the remote host. It consists of constructors, which can accept either a
host address or a hostname with a corresponding port number, and a destructor.
The available call and action methods allow for variation in data formats
that is dependent on the design of the remote host, allowing the user
to send data that follows the same design as that of their remote host,
providing customizability and flexibility. The class also has a few private
slots that handle socket errors such as disconnection.

XSync
-----
The XSync class is a subclass of XServer. It represents a
network file synchronization service that is used for uploading, downloading,
removing, and managing files and directories between a local and remote system.
XSync has methods like sync, upload, download, remove, uploadDirectory,
downloadDirectory, removeDirectory, files, tree, and treeInfo, which serve
various functionalities mentioned above. Additionally, XSync also has
public slots that communicate with other instances of the same class
over a network. All operations are initiated by a base instance,
which can then invoke the necessary methods of remote instances.
